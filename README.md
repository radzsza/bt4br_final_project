# Project outline
Aleksandra Radziukiewicz, Anastasiya Pautarak  

We decided on a simple video game focused on hardships of starting with R and ggplot2 as a student. The game's 
GUI is written in Java, using Swing. On the other hand, the displayed plots were made with R ggplot2 and then 
incorporated into the project.

## Game plot:

You are a student messaged by your lab supervisor. He sends you already prepared data and asks you to plot it for him. 
But don't worry, he also sends you a tutorial on how to make good plots. Will your skills and tools be enough to 
create good quality data visualization?

# Installing the game

Download the game.jar file and run it by either double-clicking on it or typing `java -jar game.jar`.

**Warning!**

**You need jre version 24 or higher installed.**
