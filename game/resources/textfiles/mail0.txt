Subject: Data Visualization Task

Dear Student,

Please find attached the dataset. It needs to be visualized. I would do it myself, but unfortunately, my last 
attempt with ggplot2 ended in a nervous breakdown and a corrupted R session. Your task is simple: produce a 
clear and sensible plot using ggplot2, as long as it conveys something meaningful and does not involve 3D pie 
charts. Do not overthink it. Just make it pretty. Or at least functional. I trust your plotting skills more than 
I trust my patience.

Best regards,
Max Ruzz

PS. I have added a short tutorial on how to do good plots for you.
