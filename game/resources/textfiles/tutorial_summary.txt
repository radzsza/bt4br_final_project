Summary:

• Always label axes and include units.
• Use perceptually uniform or publication-appropriate palettes.
• Show variability (density curves, raw points, error bars) whenever possible.
• Avoid visual clutter and misleading axis limits.
• Start with the data, not the graphic.

Happy plotting ;)
